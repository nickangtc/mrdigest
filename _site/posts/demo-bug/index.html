  <h1>This is the most common demo bug</h1>
  <time></time>

  <article><p>A software engineer takes the air waves and shares his screen. He is about to demo the newest integration with one of your partners. You've been waiting for this.</p>
<p>He begins to talk. But... you can't see shit. Everything appears comically tiny on your screen.</p>
<p>You slide your mouse to the <em>raise hand</em> button and prepare to say, politely, &quot;could you zoom in a bit, please?&quot; But you stop yourself a moment later, when you find out that you're actually watching a recording.</p>
<p>People tend to fumble during live presentations (<em>Vorf√ºhreffekt</em> or &quot;demonstration effect&quot;), so many understandably prefer to record. If it's a walkthrough, it's probably wise to record because then you can restart until you make the perfect glitch-free presentation.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is that engineers don't consider small font sizes a glitch. It's a feature to them, not a bug.</strong> Most software engineers I know don't even make the conscious decision to switch from coding mode to presentation mode.</p>
<p>The result is unfortunately a small tragedy. The presentation lacks luster and the hardworking folks behind the integration don't get the recognition they deserve, because it really doesn't look that impressive.</p>
<p>I'm guilty of this too, both of being an engineer and being one who forgets to zoom in.</p>
<p>As a small tangent, I've found it helpful to do more external-facing documentation work. With those, I'll always be reminded by someone (e.g. Marketing) to zoom the f* in so people can see exactly what I'm trying to show.</p>
<p>The long term fix is probably adopting the crucial mindset of the presenter, which is to say, think about your audience and present accordingly for them.</p>
