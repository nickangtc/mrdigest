  <h1>Why Mr Digest exists</h1>
  <time>2024-05-08</time>

  <article><p>Mr Digest is so named because I realised how much I tell coworkers and managers that one of my strengths is explaining things plainly to different audiences. In other words, I make things digestible. You might say I'm &quot;Mr Digest.&quot;</p>
<p>Being able to write digestible content is a superpower. And publishing digestible content is a way of contributing to the world. Misinformation causes deaths and misery. Good, clear information not only doesn't do that, but motivates and inspires.</p>
<p>I would be happy if I do that regularly. Sharpen the craft while helping the world? Sounds like a recipe for success!</p>
<p>By the way, you might have noticed the styling on this site is quite bare. I foresee this to be the case for a long time because of the singular focus on creating digestible content here. Ranking traits that make blogs attractive:</p>
<ol>
<li>high quality content</li>
<li>fluff</li>
<li>flufff</li>
<li>fluffff</li>
<li>great aesthetics</li>
</ol>
<p>I expect we'll learn to enjoy the uglified site. It's to optimise for the one thing that ultimately matters with all content on the web: the message.</p>
<p>See you around.</p>
