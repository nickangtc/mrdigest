Tell me if this sounds familiar.

You work at a company that holds an all-hands meetings once every week. It's the digital equivalent of a town hall gathering. Everyone comes to update and be updated about the latest happenings, company-wide.

A software engineer takes the air waves and shares his screen. He is about to demo the newest integration with one of your partners. You've been waiting for this.

He begins to talk. But... you can't see shit. Everything appears comically tiny on your screen.

You slide your mouse to the _raise hand_ button and prepare to say, politely, "could you zoom in a bit, please?" But you stop yourself a moment later, when you find out that you're actually watching a recording.

People tend to fumble during live presentations (_Vorf√ºhreffekt_ or "demonstration effect"), so many understandably prefer to record. If it's a walkthrough, it's probably wise to record because then you can restart until you make the perfect glitch-free presentation.

**The problem is that engineers don't consider small font sizes a glitch. It's a feature to them, not a bug.** Most software engineers I know don't even make the conscious decision to switch from coding mode to presentation mode.

The result is unfortunately a small tragedy. The presentation lacks luster and the hardworking folks behind the integration don't get the recognition they deserve, because it really doesn't look that impressive.

I'm guilty of this too, both of being an engineer and being one who forgets to zoom in.

As a small tangent, I've found it helpful to do more external-facing documentation work. With those, I'll always be reminded by someone (e.g. Marketing) to zoom the f\* in so people can see exactly what I'm trying to show.

The long term fix is probably adopting the crucial mindset of the presenter, which is to say, think about your audience and present accordingly for them.
