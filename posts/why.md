Mr Digest is so named because I realised how much I tell coworkers and managers that one of my strengths is explaining things plainly to different audiences. In other words, I make things digestible. You might say I'm "Mr Digest."

Being able to write digestible content is a superpower. And publishing digestible content is a way of contributing to the world. Misinformation causes deaths and misery. Good, clear information not only doesn't do that, but motivates and inspires.

I would be happy if I do that regularly. Sharpen the craft while helping the world? Sounds like a recipe for success!

By the way, you might have noticed the styling on this site is quite bare. I foresee this to be the case for a long time because of the singular focus on creating digestible content here. Ranking traits that make blogs attractive:

1. high quality content
2. fluff
3. flufff
4. fluffff
5. great aesthetics

I expect we'll learn to enjoy the uglified site. It's to optimise for the one thing that ultimately matters with all content on the web: the message.

See you around.
