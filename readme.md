# In development

One day I had the idea to lean into my inclination to make things digestible. Someone doesn't seem to understand something that I understood, so I write in a way that compels them to read, and in a manner that helps them understand it.

It's a blog.

A secondary goal of this blog is to explore building a blog in the 2020s using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. The core web technologies. The source code is public, so feel free to browse.
